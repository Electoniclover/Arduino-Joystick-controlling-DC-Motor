This project uses a Joystick to control a D.C. Motor.

The components I used in this project are a Joystick and a D.C. Motor. Both connected to an Arduino Uno.

After the circuitry, I programmed the Joystick X axis. I am not planning to program the Y axis.

If the variable Xval <500, the D.C. Motor will move anti-clockwise.

If Xval >800, the D.C Motor will move clockwise. If Xval >500 and <600, the D.C. Motor will do nothing.
